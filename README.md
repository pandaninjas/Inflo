# Inflo
My personal music player.

## Running yourself
You need python and pip (normally comes with python)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pandaninjas/Inflo
cd Inflo
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
It will begin automatically playing the .mp3 files in the same directory on loop. It chooses songs randomly.
